<h3>Personal Info</h3>
<p>I am <span id="myAge"></span> and enjoy learning new things. I firmly believe that someone should attempt to learn one new thing a day. I apply this in my personal life as well as my work life. Due to this thinking I have managed to learn <span id="numOfPrgLang"></span> different programming languages <span id="prgLang"></span>.</p>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>Currently I am employee at <a href="https://www.bandwidth.com/">Bandwidth</a>. I am the software engineer for the Identity team which is responsible for enabling SSO across products.</p>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I enjoy spending time with my family whether it's grilling out, fishing, or letting the kids run around. I have two boys both of which can make you tired just by watching them run in circles. I also spend time learning new things about coding as well as how to rework what I have already done with more efficiency.</p> <p>My most favorite pastime is playing billards. I have played in American Poolplayers Association (APA) since 2006. While part of this league, I have traveled to Vegas once where my team and I placed 33 out of over 850 teams. I have also played in a local cash league. I am looking forwared to the day when we acquire a pool table for our home. My wife may go crazy as I would play as often as possible, but one can dream.</p>
